# Cyber-Drone

Cyber-Drone is a fast-paced, cyberpunk-themed arcade game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Navigate your drone through a hazardous digital cityscape, avoiding obstacles, collecting Data-Bits, and completing missions to unlock new skins and achieve the highest score.

## Gameplay
The game is a side-scrolling "flappy-like" where the player must guide a drone through gaps in oncoming obstacles. The goal is to survive as long as possible and get the highest score.
